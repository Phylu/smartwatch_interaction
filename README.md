# Smartwatch Interaction -- More than just Notifications

This projects relates to a Guided Research in the Master programme Informatics at Technische Universität München

## Project Description
Wearable devices such as smartwatches are hitting the end user market these days. Companies known for their smartphones have brought smartwatches onto the market or advertised. Android wear makes it easy for developers to add smartwatch functionality into their existing apps. Several major applications have implemented such functionality by now. In many cases these implementations just show notifications from the phone on the smartwatch as well and allow the user little interaction.

In a multi device environment, developers need to know, which devices suit which interaction type. Interaction shemes that are suitable for smartphones or tables may not be user friendly on smartwatches. This guided research tries to provide insight on user interaction for smartwatches. The following research questiens shall be addressed:
* Which interaction types are available on modern smartwatches?
* Why are those types chosen for existing applications?
* Is the interaction intuitive for the user?

In this guided research, I will describe existing application solutions and how they allow interaction using the smartwatch. Different interaction types will be categorized. Possible categories could be: No Interaction, Low Interaction, High Interaction or Notification, Touch, Swipe. Based on existing interaction types, a use case with a reccomender system is developed. Interactive Mockups shall picture possible interaction models of this use case. In a user study the different models are compared against each other. Users will be shown different mockups. In a qualitative interview promising use cases shall be identified. Quantitative methods require a certain amount of participants. To get qualified feedback, participants need to use the mockups on a real device. This limits the possibility of using quantitative methods. If nevertheless possible, a quantitative part shall complement the qualitative study.
